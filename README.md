# Multi-Signature Wallet

## 1. Project Title
Multi-Signature Wallet Smart Contract in Clarity

## 2. Project Description
This project implements a simple multi-signature wallet on the Stacks blockchain using the Clarity language.  
It allows multiple owners to collectively manage funds.  
A transaction can only be executed after receiving a minimum number of required approvals.

## 3. Project Vision
To provide a secure and decentralized way of managing shared funds on the blockchain, where no single individual can unilaterally move funds.  
This ensures trust, transparency, and security for all wallet participants.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add a function to remove or add owners dynamically.
- Implement time-locks for transactions.
- Enable multi-token support beyond STX.
- Add event logging for better transaction tracking.
- Integrate with a front-end DApp for user-friendly interaction.
